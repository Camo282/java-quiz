# java-quiz

The user is presented with a start page with the header JavaScript Quiz.

Buttons are presented to start the quiz, view High Scores, and get Results.

At this time when the start button is clicked the quiz begins.  However, instead of displaying the questions in the container, a new body is created.  This is something that will have to be fixed.  The user is not yet able to get the results and time is not deducted from the 60 seconds. 

Prior to the questions being added, the timer was working but cannot be seen currently.  The high score link works but the user cannot input their initials or view others scores.
